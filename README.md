<h3 align="center">Family Guy: Full-Stack Application with Next.js</h3>



</div>



## Introduction

This is a tutorial prioject made by Yazdun from Freecodecamp.org
Here is the link of the blog: 
[How to Create a Full-Stack Application with Next.js](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/step-by-step-tutorial-for-building-your-first-full-stack-application-with-nextjs)
tutorial!

In this tutorial, I learn how NextJs works and how to handle SSR, SSG, ISR and implement them. I also learn how to handle client side components and fetch data from API. Also get a good perception about how to create API endpoint and use them in NextJs. Through this project, I got a very good understanding about NextJs and how to create a full stack App using this!
